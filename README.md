#30 Days of JavaScript - Fun with HTML5 Canvas ###Sunday June, 28, 2020 - 12:34 PM

Very cool exercise that Wes has in stored today. I had to create a canvas where you can press down and/or hold it to draw something inside the empty window browser. Today was the first time that I had written a lot of JavaScript and there was already a pre-written HTML5 code that was the canvas element with an ID of 'draw'. In order to start drawing things on the window, I needed to gran the canvas via 'document.querySelector' and then store that inside a constant variable that consisted of the 'getContext()' method. From there, I had to make sure that the entire broser window was a blank canvas. This was done by adding an innerWidth/Height to the canvas value. From then, it was history!
